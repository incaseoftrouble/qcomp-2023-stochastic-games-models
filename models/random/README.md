This folder contains a selection of the models that were randomly generated for \[1\].
All models are from [https://github.com/ga67vib/Algorithms-For-Stochastic-Games/tree/master/random-generated-models].
See [https://github.com/ga67vib/Algorithms-For-Stochastic-Games/blob/master/thesis-scripts/README.md] or the paper for some description.
All models use the same property file, models.props.
